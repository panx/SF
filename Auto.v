(** * Auto: More Automation *)

    little time learning to use some of Coq's more powerful automation
    features... *)

(** * The [auto] and [eauto] Tactics *)

(** The [auto] tactic solves goals that are solvable by any combination of 
     - [intros],
     - [apply] (with a local hypothesis, by default), and
     - [reflexivity].
       
    The [eauto] tactic works just like [auto], except that it uses
    [eapply] instead of [apply]. *)

(** Using [auto] is always "safe" in the sense that it will never fail
    and will never change the proof state: either it completely solves
    the current goal, or it does nothing.

    Here is a contrived example: *)

Lemma auto_example_1 : forall P Q R S T U : Prop,
  (P -> Q) ->
  (P -> R) ->
  (T -> R) ->
  (S -> T -> U) ->
  ((P->Q) -> (P->S)) ->
  T ->
  P ->
  U.
Proof. auto. Qed.

(** When searching for potential proofs of the current goal, [auto]
    and [eauto] consider the hypotheses in the current context
    together with a _hint database_ of other lemmas and constructors.
    Some of the lemmas and constructors we've already seen -- e.g.,
    [conj], [or_introl], and [or_intror] -- are installed in this hint
    database by default. *)

Lemma auto_example_2 : forall P Q R : Prop,
  Q ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  P \/ (Q /\ R).
Proof.
  auto. Qed.

(** We can extend the hint database just for the purposes of one
    application of [auto] or [eauto] by writing [auto using ...].
    E.g., if [conj], [or_introl], and [or_intror] had _not_ already
    been in the hint database, we could have done this instead: *)

Lemma auto_example_2a : forall P Q R : Prop,
  Q ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  P \/ (Q /\ R).
Proof.
  auto using conj, or_introl, or_intror.  Qed.

(** Of course, in any given development there will also be some of our
    own specific constructors and lemmas that are used very often in
    proofs.  We can add these to the global hint database by writing
      Hint Resolve T.
    at the top level, where [T] is a top-level theorem or a
    constructor of an inductively defined proposition (i.e., anything
    whose type is an implication).  As a shorthand, we can write
      Hint Constructors c.
    to tell Coq to do a [Hint Resolve] for _all_ of the constructors
    from the inductive definition of [c].

    It is also sometimes necessary to add
      Hint Unfold d.
    where [d] is a defined symbol, so that [auto] knows to expand
    uses of [d] and enable further possibilities for applying
    lemmas that it knows about. *)

(** Here are some [Hint]s we will find useful. *)

Hint Constructors multi.
Hint Resolve beq_id_eq beq_id_false_not_eq.

(** Warning: Just as with Coq's other automation facilities, it
    is easy to overuse [auto] and [eauto] and wind up with proofs that
    are impossible to understand later!  Also, overuse of [eauto] can
    make proof scripts very slow.  Get in the habit of using [auto]
    most of the time and [eauto] only when necessary.

    For much more detailed information about using [auto] and [eauto],
    see the chapter [UseAuto]. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** * The [Proof with] Tactic *)

(** If you start a proof by saying [Proof with (tactic)] instead of
    just [Proof], then writing [...] instead of [.] after a tactic in
    the body of the proof will try to solve all generated subgoals
    with [tactic] (and fail if this doesn't work).

    One common use of this facility is "[Proof with auto]" (or
    [eauto]).  We'll see many examples of this later in the file. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** * The [solve by inversion] Tactic *)

(** Here's another nice automation feature: it often arises that the
    context contains a contradictory assumption and we want to use
    [inversion] on it to solve the goal.  We'd like to be able to say
    to Coq, "find a contradictory assumption and invert it" without
    giving its name explicitly.

    Doing [solve by inversion] will find a hypothesis that can be
    inverted to solve the goal, if there is one.  The tactics [solve
    by inversion 2] and [solve by inversion 3] are slightly fancier
    versions which will perform two or three inversions in a row, if
    necessary, to solve the goal. 
    
    (These tactics are not actually built into Coq -- their
    definitions are in [Sflib].) 

    Caution: Overuse of [solve by inversion] can lead to slow proof
    scripts. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** * The [try solve] Tactic *)

(** If [t] is a tactic, then [try solve [t]] is a tactic that
      - if [t] solves the goal, behaves just like [t], or
      - if [t] cannot completely solve the goal, does
        nothing.

    More generally, [try solve [t1 | t2 | ...]] will try to solve the
    goal by using [t1], [t2], etc.  If none of them succeeds in
    completely solving the goal, then [try solve [t1 | t2 | ...]] does
    nothing. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** * The [f_equal] Tactic *)

(** [f_equal] replaces a goal of the form [f x1 x2 ... xn = f y1 y2
    ... yn], where [f] is some function, with the subgoals [x1 = y1],
    [x2 = y2],...,[xn = yn].  It is useful for avoiding explicit
    rewriting steps, and often the generated subgoals can be quickly
    cleared by [auto].  This tactic is not fundamental, in the sense
    that it can always be replaced by a sequence of [assert]s.
    However in some cases it can be very handy. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** * The [normalize] Tactic *)

(** When experimenting with definitions of programming languages in
    Coq, we often want to see what a particular concrete term steps
    to -- i.e., we want to find proofs for goals of the form [t ==>*
    t'], where [t] is a completely concrete term and [t'] is unknown.
    These proofs are simple but repetitive to do by hand. Consider for
    example reducing an arithmetic expression using the small-step
    relation [astep] defined in the previous chapter: *)

Definition amultistep st := multi (astep st).
Notation " t '/' st '==>a*' t' " := (amultistep st t t')
  (at level 40, st at level 39).

Example astep_example1 : 
  (APlus (ANum 3) (AMult (ANum 3) (ANum 4))) / empty_state 
  ==>a* (ANum 15).
Proof.
  apply multi_step with (APlus (ANum 3) (ANum 12)).
    apply AS_Plus2. 
      apply av_num. 
      apply AS_Mult.
  apply multi_step with (ANum 15).
    apply AS_Plus.
  apply multi_refl.
Qed.

(** We repeatedly apply [multi_step] until we get to a normal
    form. The proofs that the intermediate steps are possible are
    simple enough that [auto], with appropriate hints, can solve
    them. *)

Hint Constructors astep aval.
Example astep_example1' : 
  (APlus (ANum 3) (AMult (ANum 3) (ANum 4))) / empty_state 
  ==>a* (ANum 15).
Proof.
  eapply multi_step. auto. simpl.
  eapply multi_step. auto. simpl.
  apply multi_refl.
Qed.

(** The following custom [Tactic Notation] definition captures this
    pattern.  In addition, before each [multi_step] we print out the
    current goal, so that the user can follow how the term is being
    evaluated. *)

Tactic Notation "print_goal" := match goal with |- ?x => idtac x end.
Tactic Notation "normalize" := 
   repeat (print_goal; eapply multi_step ; 
             [ (eauto 10; fail) | (instantiate; simpl)]);
   apply multi_refl.

Example astep_example1'' : 
  (APlus (ANum 3) (AMult (ANum 3) (ANum 4))) / empty_state 
  ==>a* (ANum 15).
Proof.
  normalize.
  (* At this point in the proof script, the Coq response shows 
     a trace of how the expression evaluated. 

   (APlus (ANum 3) (AMult (ANum 3) (ANum 4)) / empty_state ==>a* ANum 15)
   (multi (astep empty_state) (APlus (ANum 3) (ANum 12)) (ANum 15))
   (multi (astep empty_state) (ANum 15) (ANum 15))
*)
Qed.

(** The [normalize] tactic also provides a simple way to calculate
    what the normal form of a term is, by proving a goal with an
    existential variable in it. *)

Example astep_example1''' : exists e',
  (APlus (ANum 3) (AMult (ANum 3) (ANum 4))) / empty_state 
  ==>a* e'.
Proof.
  eapply ex_intro. normalize.

(* This time, the trace will be:

    (APlus (ANum 3) (AMult (ANum 3) (ANum 4)) / empty_state ==>a* ??)
    (multi (astep empty_state) (APlus (ANum 3) (ANum 12)) ??)
    (multi (astep empty_state) (ANum 15) ??)

   where ?? is the variable ``guessed'' by eapply.
*)
Qed.


(** **** Exercise: 1 star (normalize_ex) *)
Theorem normalize_ex : exists e',
  (AMult (ANum 3) (AMult (ANum 2) (ANum 1))) / empty_state

Theorem normalize_ex' : exists e',

Proof.

  eapply multi_step.  apply AS_Mult2. apply av_num.
  apply AS_Mult.
  eapply multi_step. simpl. apply AS_Mult. simpl. apply multi_refl.
